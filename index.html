    <p>
    Hi! I am a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ps.tm.kit.edu/english/index.php">Chair of IT Security</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My main focus lies on creating formal privacy notions for group-based anonymous communication.
        Once formal privacy goals have been established, present and future anonymous group communication networks can be analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am also researching <em>anonymous publish/subscribe networks</em> in a joined project with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/telekooperation/telecooperation_group/index.en.jsp">Telecooperation Lab</a> at TU Darmstadt.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my master's thesis, I conducted a formal analysis of the anonymous communication network <em>Vuvuzela</em>, in which I found and fixed serious weaknesses against sender timing and replay attacks.
        You can find the thesis <a target="_blank" href="doc/thesis.pdf">here</a>.
