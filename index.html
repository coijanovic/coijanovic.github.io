    <h1>Christoph Coijanovic</h1>
    <p>
    Hi! I am a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ps.tm.kit.edu/english/index.php">Chair of IT Security</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
    Currently, I am visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch">Kenny Paterson's group</a> at ETH Zurich.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My research is focused on anonymous group communication.
        Anonymous communication aims to hide not only the <i>contents</i> of communication but also the <i>metadata</i> that occurs during communication.
        Metadata includes information such as how often and with whom people communicate. 
        To entities such as service providers and government surveillance agencies, metadata is often of greater interest than the actual message content.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anonymous one-to-one communication has been intensely studied since the early 1980s, both from a theoretical as well as practical perspective.
    Group communication has received considerably less attention, although it is an indispensable feature of any (non-anonymous) popular communication platform (e.g., WhatsApp, Zoom, etc.).
    Achieving anonymous group communication is especially challenging, as the amount of metadata that needs to be protected is strictly greater than in the one-to-one case.
    Additional privacy-sensitive information includes group sizes and membership among others.
    </p>

    I explore the challenges of anonymous group communication from three different perspectives:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Adaption of Common Anonymous Communication Building Blocks.</b>
            I investigate how common building blocks of anonymous communication, such as mix networks or Private Information Retrieval, can be adapted to support group communication.
            If we can find generally applicable adaptions, a large number of existing anonymous communication networks can be extended to support group communication.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Purpose-Build Anonymous Group Communication.</b>
            In most cases, purpose-built protocols can be significantly more efficient than general-purpose ones.
            Efficiency is especially important in anonymous group communication, as anonymization mechanisms such as cover traffic and layered encryptions introduce significant overhead.
            Thus, my goal is to build specialized protocols that enable anonymous group communication for use cases where it was previously not efficient enough.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Anonymous Group Management.</b>
            An area orthogonal to group communication but equally interesting is group membership management, i.e., enabling users to join and leave groups.
            As membership management can reveal sensitive information about the group's composition and activity, I investigate how it can be made oblivious to an outside observer.
        </li>
    </ul>
